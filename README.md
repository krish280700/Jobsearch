## Insights and Results

### Insights:
During the development of this movie library management application, I gained insights into the following key aspects:
- **Express.js Routing**: Understanding and implementing routing in Express.js for managing different views and actions.
- **Form Validation**: Implementing client-side form validation using regular expressions to ensure data integrity.
- **Express Validator**: Implementing server-side form validation using express-validator to ensure data integrity.
- **Mongo DB**: Understanding and Implementing Database Management in Mongo DB for handling CRUD Operations.

### Results:
- **Successful CRUD Operations**: The application allows users to successfully perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movies.
- **Validation Feedback**: Implemented server-side form validation provides users with immediate feedback on the correctness of their input.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and manage contacts.

### Challenges Faced:
- **Mongo DB**: Learning and Implementing MongoDB Atlas and Mongo DB methods took some time.
